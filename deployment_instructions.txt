IMPORTANT NOTES
-------------
- The free tier of Vercel has some limitations:
  - Limited compute resources
  - No persistent file storage (uploaded resumes will be lost on redeployment)
  - Limited execution time for functions
- For a student project, these limitations are usually not a problem

TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------
- If deployment fails, check the Vercel logs for details
- Make sure your code doesn't have any syntax errors
- Verify that all files from the zip are uploaded to GitHub

For more detailed instructions, refer to the deployment_guide.md file included in the zip.

Enjoy your new Job Aggregator application!
